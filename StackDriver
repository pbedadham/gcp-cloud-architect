Use Stackdriver Monitoring to look for insights that show when your API latencies are high – 
this could tell you when the API call latency reaching to certain threshold/criteria but can hardly tell where the root causes is without additional setup and analysis. 

Reference Resources 

Stackdriver Trace can help you answer the following questions: 
https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/overview
•	How long does it take my application to handle a given request? 
•	Why is it taking my application so long to handle a request? 
•	Why do some of my requests take longer than others? 
•	What is the overall latency of requests to my application? 
•	Has latency for my application increased or decreased over time? 
•	What can I do to reduce application latency? 

“As micro-services become more popular, the cross-application tracing provided by Stackdriver Trace becomes essential in pinpointing the root cause of latency issues.”
